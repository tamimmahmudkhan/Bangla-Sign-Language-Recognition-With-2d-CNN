# Bangla-Sign-Language-Recognition-With-2d-CNN
Bangla Sign Language Recognition with 2 Dimentional CNN


This project was done as our University Graduation Thesis. 

Previous models were only capable of classifying a small subset of the Bangla Sign Language. Models were tested only on the Bangla Equivalent of  Vowels [স্বরবর্ণ] or Consonants [ব্যঞ্জনবর্ণ] or numbers only.

Our model was tested on a total of 30 classes which contain both Vowels and Consonants and we have achieved the highest accuracy from all models tested.
